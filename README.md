# phpietadmin
Phpietadmin is an easy to use webinterface to control the iet daemon (http://sourceforge.net/projects/iscsitarget/) written in php and javascript.

## Intention
The main reason for developing this was, to create a way to configure the daemon while it’s in use. The iet daemon reads
the config file only at start/restart. Changes after the daemon was started are only possible via the ietadm command line
tool. This tool alters the configuration of the daemon while it’s running. Unfortunatly, the changes are not reflected
in the config file itself. Which means, if the daemon gets restart the changes made via ietadm are gone, because the
daemons loads only the targets from the config file. Phpietadmin saves all changes in the config file and passes them
directly to the daemon via php’s „exec“ function. This prevents any inconsistency between the config file and the
daemon live config.

## Compatibility
Phpietadmin is tested on Debian 7 and 8. But it’s not limited to Debian.
It should run just fine on any other linux distribution.
